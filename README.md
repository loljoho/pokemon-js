The name of the game is **Pokémon**.

## Overview

We will be coding out some of the features found in **Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow** and other similar "old school" turn-based Role-Playing Games (RPGs).

This repository will contain the source code that I write over the course of the review session(s).  

### Background

**Pokémon Trainers** travel the world capturing **wild Pokémon** and training them in battle.

Each captured Pokémon is housed in its own **Poké Ball**.  Trainers are allowed a maximum of **six (6)** Poké Balls on their belt at any given time.

### Objectives

To implement some of the basic features and logic of the original Pokémon games in JavaScript.
